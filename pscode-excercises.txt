a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Start
 input num1, input num2, input num3, input num4, input num5
 avg = (num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5)/5
 smallest = > num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
 largest = < num1, num2, num3, num4, num5
 print (avg)
 print (small)
 print (large)
Output
